### Purpose

The goal of this project is to improve upon the self-assembly algorithm presented by Rubenstein, Cornejo, and Nagpal in the paper <i>Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm</i>. Their algorithm "guarantees that a large group of robots, with limited capabilities and local communication, can cooperatively assemble into any 1-connected user-specified shape (with some restrictions)." Informally, this means it works on shapes having no "holes" or "cutouts". My goal in particular is to extend their algorithm to work on any 1-connected shape in general, including those having holes or cutouts.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jpskycak/Programmable-Self-Assembly/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
